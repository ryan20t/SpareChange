{"name":"spare change","tagline":"ryan alves : as capstone project : summer 2014","body":"### Development Update\r\n\r\nThe development phase of the project has begun. The sign up and log in functions are essentially complete. Transaction insertion is functional, and the today view section of the dashboard is mostly finished with the exception of the savings goal meter, which will be completed after the ability to create a goal is coded. Todayâ€™s transactions are displayed, as is daily spending limit, amount spent, and amount remaining.\r\n\r\nThe design of the settings page has been reworked to better represent its contents. Insertion of new static and budgeted bills is functional. The bills are not yet displayed back to the user, but this will be the next thing I add.\r\n\r\nError handling has been added for sign up, log in and bill entry, and next to transaction entry. It aggregates input errors and can output them, but is not fully implemented yet. I need to incorporate the displayed messages into the design of the application.\r\n\r\n### [Proposal](http://goo.gl/eNFVr0)\r\n\r\n### [Prototype](http://goo.gl/VRBtMn)\r\n\r\n### [Technical Specification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8qGAFaVeOwINkViNzZ1Wmp5eVU/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n### [MySQL File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8qGAFaVeOwIcEhPTURlRTNVZms/edit?usp=sharing)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
