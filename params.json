After that, some work needs to be put into cleaning up the layout to at least make it relatively organized and easy to read.\r\n\r\n## [Proposal](http://goo.gl/eNFVr0)\r\n\r\n## [Prototype](http://goo.gl/VRBtMn)\r\n\r\n## [Technical Specification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8qGAFaVeOwINkViNzZ1Wmp5eVU/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n## [MySQL File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8qGAFaVeOwIUlNsWC13aXc2cDQ/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n## [Code ZIP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8qGAFaVeOwIejl1cXI0U0tfbW8/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n## Previous Updates\r\n\r\n### Week 6 Update\r\n\r\nThis week I have done a lot of work on the settings page. Income information is modifiable and displayed. Bills are now displayed. It is mostly functioning, with the noticeable exception of the savings goal not being implemented yet. I also spent some time trying to switch the SQL code over to stored procedures, only to realize that PhP is not terribly friendly with stored procedures. This project was scrapped. Additionally, I added a confirmation prompt before the deletion of a bill or transaction.\r\n\r\nThe application is not hosted live. It can be found here: http://sparechange.comoj.com/login.php\r\n\r\nI’ve set up a website detailing the project and my progress. It can be viewed here: http://ryan20t.github.io/SpareChange/ \r\n\r\nNext week the goal will be to finish up the settings page, and include the savings goal meter on the dashboard to the working sections of the application.\r\n\r\n### Week 5 Update\r\n\r\nThe development phase of the project has begun. The sign up and log in functions are essentially complete. Transaction insertion is functional, and the today view section of the dashboard is mostly finished with the exception of the savings goal meter, which will be completed after the ability to create a goal is coded. Today’s transactions are displayed, as is daily spending limit, amount spent, and amount remaining.\r\n\r\nThe design of the settings page has been reworked to better represent its contents. Insertion of new static and budgeted bills is functional. The bills are not yet displayed back to the user, but this will be the next thing I add.\r\n\r\nError handling has been added for sign up, log in and bill entry, and next to transaction entry. It aggregates input errors and can output them, but is not fully implemented yet. I need to incorporate the displayed messages into the design of the application.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
